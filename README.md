# ReadingsBot
Discord Bot for automated posting of lives of the Orthodox saints.

# Usage
The default prefix for the bot is `%`. This can be changed by calling `%setprefix`. 
If `%` is already used by a bot on the server, you may invoke any command including `setprefix` by mentioning ReadingsBot instead.

Other commands may be seen by running `%help`. In addition, running `%help` with a command name as the argument (`%help [command]`) will give more information about the command.
